# fetchme
This project just got started and it's still in infancy. The pretty fonts and the colorful images are a work in progress.

## What
fetchme will hopefully become a simple program written in C to get information about your system on Linux and display it in manner worthy of r/unixporn. 

## Roadmap
- More extensive information about the system.
- Formatting the output.
- Optimizing for speed.
- Customization options.
- Better image retrieval logic.
